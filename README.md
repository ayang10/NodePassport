<p>Run 'mongo' in cmmd prompt *make sure it's in Admin mode and you're inside the bin directory for MongoDB
<p>Run 'show dbs' will show all your dbs that's available then add a new db name loginapp with 'use loginapp'
<p>Open another cmmd prompt *make sure it's in Admin mode and also inside the mongodb bin directory wherever you saved it and run 'mongodb' - always have this running.
